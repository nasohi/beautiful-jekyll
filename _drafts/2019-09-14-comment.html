title: 'To make sure any file or folder you create in /var/www/html gets automatically
  owned by www-data you can use inotify, it''s like cron but monitors folders/files
  for changes in attribuets, file creations, modifications and much more.  First install
  it with:  $ sudo apt-get install incron Allow root to use incron by opening /etc/incron.allow
  with:  $ sudo vim /etc/incron.allow and add root to the file, then save and exit.  Edit
  your incrontab with:  $ sudo incrontab -u root -e and add the following line to
  it:  /var/www/html IN_CREATE /bin/chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/ save
  and exit.  Now as soon as a file is created in the /var/www/html direcotry it will
  automatically set onwership to www-data:www-data.  Explanation of the line in incrontab:  /var/www/html
  is the directory that will be monitored.  IN_CREATE will watch for created files.
  It''s the file change mask.  /bin/chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/ is the
  command/action to execute.'
