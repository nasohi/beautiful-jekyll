On Linux or macOS, we can generate a key with the ssh-keygen command.<br /><br />Open a terminal and then use the ssh-keygen command to generate a new key. Specify the -C flag to add a comment with your username.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] -C [USERNAME]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span>where:<br /><br />[KEY_FILENAME] is the name that you want to use for your SSH key files. For example, a filename of <b>myserver-ssh-key</b> generates a private key file named <b>myserver-ssh-key </b>and a public key file named <b>myserver-ssh-key.pub</b>.<br /><br />[USERNAME] is the username on the instance.<br /><br />This command generates a private SSH key file and a matching public SSH key with the following structure:<br /><br />ssh-rsa [KEY_VALUE] [USERNAME]<br /><br />where:<br /><br />[KEY_VALUE] is the key value that you generated.<br /><br />[USERNAME] is the user on instance that this key applies to.<br /><br />Restrict access to your private key so that only you can read it and nobody can write to it.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">chmod 400 ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME]</span><br /><br />Locate the public SSH keys to add to instance. It&nbsp; can be done&nbsp; via&nbsp; menu edit instance to place the public SSH key.
