<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">It can not be denied that the competition is always related to victory and defeat.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">This time I shared a bit of writing from my thinking about winning and losing a competition.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Talk about victory is also related to defeat.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I have experienced victory and also defeat.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Such a deplorable defeat at the end of an opportunity that does not happen again.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">What has been fought as if to be in vain, is only a regret of regret.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">As time goes by I realize more and more that competition is not just about defeat and victory.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Competition is more than a competition.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The competition requires competence.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Competition is the ability.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Ability to rise, ability to contribute, the ability to strive better.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">When the competition is over, it's time for collaboration.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Do not just competition but go for collaboration.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">So I conclude the competition is the beginning of the collaboration.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Again the objective of the competition is not to beat each other but as a benchmark of ability, to be a country that can compete with other countries.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Competing well for the realization of global success.</span>
